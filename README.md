# Reverse engeneering with Arduino Uno 

With this program you can let your Arduino analize logic circuits with up to 18 inputs or outputs

## Useage:

0. Connect your logic circuit to the arduino 
    
    + circuit inputs are on pin 11, 12 and 13
    + circuit outputs are on pin 5 and 7

1. After uploading the program open the serial console.

2. The Arduino will iterate troug the different combinations of `on`or `off`of the _input pins_ and record the state of the _output pins_.

3. The arduino will display a logic chart showing the states of all _output pins_ for all combinations of _input pins_

## Installation:

Download one of the versions from the branches and upload it to your Arduino using the IDE
